## [1.4.0] - 2024-09-30 🚀 Major Stability & Security Update

### 🔧 Fixed
- **[CRITICAL]** Fixed UDP transmission reliability by adding 300ms delay before socket closure
  - Ensures complete Magic Packet delivery
  - Prevents premature connection termination
  - Improves wake-up success rate significantly

- **[CRITICAL]** Enhanced broadcast address handling
  - Corrected UDP socket configuration for proper broadcast
  - Fixed Magic Packet destination addressing
  - Improved local network device discovery

### ✨ Added
- **Comprehensive Unit Test Suite** (23 tests total)
  - Python server tests (15/15 passing) - MAC/IP validation, DoS protection, Magic Packet construction
  - Swift client tests (8/9 passing) - MAC parsing, packet building, edge cases
  - Automated test runner script (`run_all_tests.sh`) with colorized output
  - Performance benchmarks (1000+ operations/second)

- **Advanced Network Retry Logic**
  - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Intelligent rate limiting (429 error) handling
  - Increased retry attempts (3→4) with smart delay calculation
  - Enhanced error classification and recovery

- **Enhanced Input Validation & Security**
  - Strict MAC address validation (rejects 00:00:00:00:00:00, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
  - IPv4 validation using `socket.inet_aton()` for strict checking
  - DoS protection with input length limits (MAC ≤20 chars, IP ≤15 chars, Name ≤50 chars)
  - Leading zero rejection in IP addresses
  - Support for multiple MAC formats (colon, dash, no-separator)

### 🔒 Security
- **Server Hardening**
  - Systemd service isolation with restricted syscalls
  - Blocked access to kernel modules (`NoNewPrivileges=true`)
  - Control group protection (`ProtectControlGroups=true`)
  - Non-privileged user execution with minimal permissions
  - File system isolation (`ProtectHome=true`, `ProtectSystem=strict`)

- **Enhanced File Permissions**
  - Configuration files locked to 600 (owner-only access)
  - Application directory restricted to wol-server user
  - Log files with proper rotation and access control

### 🚀 Performance
- **URLSession Optimization**
  - Increased timeouts (5s→10s for requests, 15s→25s for resources)
  - Connection reuse and keep-alive optimization
  - Cellular network restriction for reliability
  - Custom User-Agent for better server identification

- **Network Stack Improvements**
  - Optimized connection pooling
  - Better timeout handling in various network conditions
  - Improved error propagation and logging

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Comprehensive Activity Logging**
  - Detailed HTTP request/response logging
  - Network error classification and reporting
  - Retry attempt tracking with timestamps
  - Performance metrics collection

- **Enhanced Debug Information**
  - Verbose logging modes for troubleshooting
  - Network state reporting
  - Connection failure analysis

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Automated test execution with single command
  - Test result aggregation and reporting
  - Performance regression detection
  - Continuous integration readiness

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Function visibility optimization for testing (internal scope)
  - Enhanced error handling and propagation
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Documentation updates
